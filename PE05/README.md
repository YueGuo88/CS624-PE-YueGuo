# Input
Users input city and country information via the mobile app's interface. The 'AddCity' and 'AddCountry' screens prompt users to enter city and country names, serving as the critical input data.

# Process
React Navigation facilitates smooth screen transitions, allowing users to navigate between 'Cities,' 'AddCity,' 'Countries,' and 'AddCountry.' The functions `addCity` and `addCountry` handle the input data, updating the 'cities' and 'countries' arrays dynamically. The state management ensures that the app processes user input effectively.

# Output
The app visually outputs the stored data on screens like 'Cities' and 'Countries.' The 'Cities' screen displays a list of added cities, and the 'Countries' screen shows a list of countries. The 'AddCity' and 'AddCountry' screens provide feedback on successful data addition, offering users a clear understanding of the output resulting from their interactions.
