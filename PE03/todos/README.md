# To-Do App with Expo

## Description

This is a simple To-Do app developed using Expo, React Native, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks or to-do lists. This README provides information on how to install and run the app, as well as an overview of its features.

## Features

- Create new to-do items.
- Mark to-do items as complete.
- Delete to-do items.
- Filter and view to-do items by their completion status (All, Active, Completed).
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Input

The primary input for this app is user interaction. Users can create new to-do items, mark them as complete, or delete them. The input elements include text input fields for adding tasks and buttons for marking tasks as done or deleting them.

## Process

The core functionality of the app is implemented using JavaScript, React Native, and Expo. User interactions trigger actions such as adding a new to-do item, toggling the completion status, or deleting tasks. The program manages these interactions by maintaining a dynamic list of to-do items in memory.

## Output

The app's output is the user interface displayed on the user's mobile device. Users can see their to-do list, add new tasks, mark them as complete, or remove them. The app provides visual feedback, such as task completion status updates and dynamic filtering based on whether tasks are active or completed. The user's interactions and the app's responses provide the overall output, making task management more convenient and efficient.

This program simplifies task organization and management, offering a practical solution for keeping track of one's to-do list.
